/**
 * In these lexiEncode and -Decode functions, a double is encoded or decoded into a lexical
 * representation to be used in the rowID in the Accumulo key.
 *
 * In the lexiEncodeDoubleToString function, the double is truncated via floor() to four significant digits,
 * giving a scientific notation of #.###E0. This is to ensure that there is flexibility in the
 * precision of the bounding box given when querying for chunks. Prior to rounding the resolution,
 * it was found that even that slightest change in bounding box caused the resolution to be calculated
 * differently many digits after the decimal point, leading to a different lexical representation of the
 * resolution. This meant that no chunks would be returned out of Accumulo, since they did not match
 * the resolution calculated upon ingest.
 *
 * Now, there is greater flexibility in specifying a bounding box and calculating a resolution because
 * we save only four digits after the decimal point.
